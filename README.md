# 👨‍💻 About Me:
⚡I’m living the dream.🔭<br><br>I’ve always been a great problem solver, an independent introvert, and a technophile obsessed with the latest devices. Today, I’m working from home as a software engineer for TopLearn Company, and I get to show off all these elements of who I am.<br><br>I started learning to code when I was a teenager, though it was always more of a hobby than a career focus. After a college education in Information Technology, and continuing to pursue that hobby, I realized software engineering was the right field for me.<br><br>Since then, I’ve worked on countless freelance projects and have been involved with a handful of notable startups. Today, I’m working as a junior developer with the amazing team at TopLearn Company, and am getting into machine learning on my own time.<br><br>I’m familiar with a variety of programming languages, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C# , Asp.net Core, jQuery, and Fluttter , UI & UX, but I’m always adding new skills to my repertoire. I’m also eager to meet other software engineers in the area, so feel free to connect!<br><br>In 2022, I am studying software engineering at the master's level.<br>My goal after my master's degree is to continue my studies at the doctoral level and I am very interested in this subject.<br><br>My personal interest is in the field of web development and design.<br>The programming language I work with professionally is C# language, Asp.net Core framework.<br>I always believe that I will remain a student forever.
